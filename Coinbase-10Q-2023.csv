,,,,
,Monthly Transacting Users,,,
,,,,
,"We define an ""MTU"" as a consumer who actively or passively transacts in one or",,,
,more products on our platform at least once during the rolling 28-day period,,,
,ending on the date of measurement. MTUs presented for the end of a quarter are,,,
,the average of each month's MTUs in each respective quarter. MTUs engage in,,,
,transactions that generate both transaction revenue and subscription and,,,
,services revenue. Revenue-generating transactions include active transactions,,,
,such as buying or selling crypto assets through our Invest product or passive,,,
,transactions such as earning a staking reward. MTUs also engage in transactions,,,
,that are non-revenue generating such as send and receive. MTUs may overstate the,,,
,number of unique consumers due to differences in product architecture or user,,,
,behavior.,,,
,,,,
,Trading Volume,,,
,,,,
,"We define ""Trading Volume"" as the total U.S. dollar equivalent value of spot",,,
,matched trades transacted between a buyer and seller through our platform during,,,
,the period of measurement. Trading Volume represents the product of the quantity,,,
,of asset transacted and the trade price at the time the transaction was,,,
,"executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue, we believe",,,
,"this measure is a reflection of liquidity on our order books, trading health,",,,
,"and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. Generally, Trading Volume on our",,,
,"platform is primarily influenced by the price of crypto assets, Crypto Asset",,,
,Volatility and macroeconomic conditions. In periods of high crypto asset prices,,,
,"and Crypto Asset Volatility, we have experienced correspondingly high levels of",,,
,Trading Volume on our platform. Our Trading Volume in future periods will depend,,,
,"on the relative availability and adoption of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto",,,
,assets.,,,
